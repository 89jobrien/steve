# General Code Style Principles

This document outlines general coding principles that apply across all languages and frameworks used in this project.

## Readability

- Class and function names should be descriptive and reveal intent.
- Variable names should be descriptive and reveal intent.
- Constants should be named in all caps with underscores.
- Functions should be named in snake_case.
- Classes should be named in PascalCase.
- Modules should be named in snake_case.
- Files should be named in kebab-case.
- Code should be easy to read and understand by humans.
- Avoid overly clever or obscure constructs.

## Consistency

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- Maintain consistent formatting, naming, and structure.

## Simplicity

- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

## Maintainability

- Write code that is easy to modify and extend.
- Minimize dependencies and coupling.

## Documentation

- Only add documentation when it is necessary to understand the code.
- Avoid adding documentation to code that is self-explanatory.
- Don't add comments unless they are necessary to understand the code.
- All Python files should have a module docstring.
- All Python classes should have a class docstring.
- Python functions should only have a docstring if they are complex or non-obvious.
- Document _why_ something is done, not just _what_.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
